## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Platform Approach

The INDUSA platform is designed with a shared resource layer that ensures consistency across all platforms while allowing for platform-specific optimizations.

### Shared Resources Layer

The `shared-resources/` folder contains platform-agnostic code:

- **Models**: TypeScript interfaces that define data structures for products, users, orders, etc.
- **Constants**: Brand configuration, colors, API endpoints, error messages
- **Utils**: Pure functions for data manipulation, validation, formatting, and business logic
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive sample data for development and testing

### Web Application (React/TypeScript)

**Tech Stack:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling and fast development
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system
- React Context API for state management
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for API calls and caching

**Key Features:**

- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Advanced virtual try-on interface
- Comprehensive shopping cart and checkout flow
- User authentication and account management
- Advanced product catalog with search, filtering, and sorting
- Personal wardrobe management with outfit creation
